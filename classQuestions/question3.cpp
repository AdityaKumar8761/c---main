// Question 3:
// A software developer manages employee data for a company. The company needs a way to sort the employees based on their salaries to prepare for annual performance reviews. Implement this scenario to sort the employees using the selection sort algorithm.
// Details:
// 路 Each employee is represented by a structure that includes their name and salary.
// 路 The company needs to sort the employees in descending order of salaries. If two employees have the same salary, they should retain their original order.
// Input:
// An array of Employee structures is given. Each structure contains the following information:
// 路 name: a string representing the employee's name.
// 路 salary: an integer representing the employee's salary.
